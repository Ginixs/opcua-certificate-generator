# OPC UA Certificate Generator

--- DOESN'T WORK YET. WIP ---

OPCUA Certificate Generator is a desktop app (Windows/Mac) that can be used to generate a Certificate Authority and server/client certificate which can be used in a OPC UA environment.

Also plan on adding support for generating CRL's.

The project is open-source so please feel free to contribute to the project.
